		This website is the geoportfolio of MAX JAEGER. The website entails
		information that is academically and profesionally related to the field of geospatial science
		<p>
		I was born on the 8th of July, 2002 and raised in the Western Suburbs of Melbourne. I am currently in my fourth year of study, pursuing a Bachelor of Applied Science (Surveying) (Honours). My surveying related interest is working with GNSS equipment, cadastral surveying, and hydrographic surveying. 
		My current surveying projects involve hydrographic analysis of the riverbed in Pykes Creek Reservoir.
		</p>
		<p>
		My own personal hobbies include race cars, freestyle Motocross, Motocross, camping, listening to music, game hunting, paintball, freestyle BMX.

		Cadastral Surveying is the practice of establishing and re-establishing property boundaries. It is imperative that the new generation of cadastral surveyors are correctly informed of standard practices and procedures when conducting these activities as to maintain the integrity of the Victorian Cadastre.
		Throughout my study of the GEOM2101 course, there were a number of projects which stand out in displaying the importance of the practices and procedures required from a cadastral surveyor: 
		<ul> <!--Bullet points below-->
			<li>Assessment 2b: Urban Cadastral Re-establishment, A worksheet and Abstract of Field Record</li>
			<li>Assessment 3: Plan of Subdivision, A plan of subdivision for a proposed development</li>

		Applied Geospatial Techniques (AGT) is a very practical course as it utilises skills from disciplines that typically interact within the geospatial industry, these disciplines include:
		<ul>
			<li>Surveying</li>
			<li>Geographical Information Systems (GIS)</li>
			<li>Cartography</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		For the 2021 version of the course which I completed, the assignment was about the proposal of a new amphitheatre within the Deep Rock Oval located at Yarra Bend Park.
		The main deliverables of the subject consisted of producing:
		<ul>
			<li>Topographic survey map of Deep Rock Oval</li>
			<li>3D generated scene of the proposed amphitheatre</li>
			<li>Amphitheatre and Pathway plan of the proposed site</li>
			<li>Final map of the amphitheatre proposal</li>
		</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			The topographic survey map was created using surveying data obtained on the field using a total station at Yarra Bend Park.
			The topographic map was made using LISCAD.SEE and LISCAD.CAD. The 3D generated scene was created using the ArcGIS suite program ArcScene while the raw data was
			modified in ArcGIS Pro. The proposed pathway was created using ArcMap by using the GIS program to generate the pathway based on slope angle and the amphitheatre
			based on z-values. The final map used Adobe Illustrator to create the map along with ArcMap for exporting the 2D amphitheathre image and ArcScene for 
			exporting the image of the 3D scene.

		This page will briefly cover all my work experience (as of September 2024) within the surveying industry. The two main companies that I have worked at

		My time at Farren Land Surveys had me involved in a number of different surveying activities such as construction set out, as-constructed surveys, feature surveys, 
		re-establishment survey. I was also familiarised with using the Trimble S-series total stations, R10 GNSS antenna and the TSC7 and TSC3 series controllers. I was also exposed
		to using TOPCON MAGNET Office in order to perform computations for re-establishments as well as establishing jobs onto the Map Grid of Australia (MGA2020) as well as the
		Australian Height Datum (AHD).
		<p>
		Furthermore, my time at Farren Land Surveys has taught me the importance of professional practice within the workplace. During my employment, I have realised the importance
		of how you present yourself in the office in front of collegues as well as clients and how that is used to convey the professionalism established within the business.

		My work at Barwon Water involved conducting surveys in order to upkeep Barwon Water's network of underground assets as well as upkeep on many of the dam/reservoirs that were in the jurisdiction of Barwon Water. 
		Some of the survey related tasks that I was involved in include:
		<ul>

			<li> Feature surveys for the construction of newly proposed pipelines</li>

			<li> Working with cable location services in order to ensure the safety of the construction team on given work sites</li>

			<li> Monitoring surveys of dams/reservoirs to ensure movement within the dam walls are within safe thresholds</li>

			<li> As-constructed surveys on newly built assets to ensure that assets are located as proposed in the design</li>

			<li> GNSS subsidence monitoring of the Anglesea and Gerangamete region to establish whether drawing water from underground aquifers is not causing subsidence within those regions</li>

			<li> Differential levelling in order to put the survey control network of a given job onto the Australian Height Datum (AHD)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
		During my work at Barwon water I was able to familiarise myself with Leica Instruments (MS60) as well as their GNSS antennas (GS18) using Leica Captivwate on a CS18 controller.
		I have also had exposure to 12d field as wel as using the 12d software to process survey data in order to send off to the GIS department.
